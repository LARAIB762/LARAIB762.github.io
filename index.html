<h5>
My Achievement</h5>
<p>
Back in the 3rd academic year of the college, We were given a project in DBMS and it included several exercises. Hence, we as a group of three were required to submit the project before the specific deadline assigned by the faculty member. As a group leader I had split the work load into three but my group mates were least bothered towards the project, and they didn't complete there part but I on the other hand executed my part and when I came to recognize about there progress I completed the project single-handed and submitted it before the deadline. And I attained 48/50 mark in my project. Therefore, this was one of my most notable achievement, and I acquire a lot from the experience.</p>
